# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
This project aims to predict the risk of heart disease based on various medical features, such as age, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure, using machine learning algorithms. Multiple models, including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, KNN, SVC, and AdaBoost, were trained and evaluated on a dataset to determine the most effective approach for classification.

Key Highlights:

Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and applied SMOTE for addressing class imbalance.

Models: Evaluated multiple classification models including Random Forest, KNN, Logistic Regression, SVC, and AdaBoost.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Used GridSearchCV to optimize the Random Forest model, resulting in improved performance.

Evaluation: The Random Forest model achieved an accuracy of 88.37%, outperforming other models.

Technologies Used:

Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, SMOTE, GridSearchCV, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

This project showcases the implementation of machine learning techniques for healthcare predictions and aims to contribute to early heart disease detection.
